# Atlassian JIRA Plugin Base

This is a generic base pom.xml for an Atlassian JIRA plugin.

The whole repository is a [Template Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template/) to be used as a basis for new JIRA plugin projects using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and the [Atlassian SDK](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/).

Alternatively one can create a JIRA plugin [using the SDK](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/create-a-helloworld-plugin-project/) and use the pom.xml from this repo to get started more easily.
